# Singlestocks 
This is my first github code which takes a few single stocks from yahoo finance and 1) calculates their buy and hold return based on adjusted close price and 2) calculates correlation between the stock pairs in both up and down moves separately and 3) uses markov chains to predict up, down, steady moves and backtests the same and does the accuracy prediction (precision, recall, F1 score) and a distributional comparison KL divergence for a given time period. The predictions are not great but its an approach to think surely. Lot of good help from Copilot and gemini(AI in google search)
